            1 Doctors who attend elderly people in nursing homes often prescribe tranquilizers to keep these people immobile. 2 This practice is often unwarranted, and 3 it often impairs the health of the patients. 4 These tranquilizers often have damaging side effects in that 5 they accentuate the symptoms of senility, and 6 they increase the likelihood of a dangerous fall because 7 they produce unsteadiness in walking. Furthermore, since 8 these medications produce immobility, 9 they increase the risk of bedsores. 10 Doctors at the Center for Aging and Health say that physicians who care for the elderly are simply prescribing too much medication.

            1 All of us have encountered motorists who will go to any length to get a parking spot within 20 feet of the door they expect to enter. 2 This obsession with good parking spots transcends all logic. 3 It might take 5 minutes to secure the ideal spot in a store parking lot, 4 while a more distant spot that is immediately available is only a 40-second walk from the door. 5 Waiting for that ideal spot also results in frenzied nerves and skyrocketing blood pressure. 6 Inevitably the occupant of the desired space will preen her hair before departing, and 7 all the while the cars backed up behind the waiting driver are blaring their horns. 8 Parking a little farther away is usually easier and safer because 9 you can pull out more quickly, and 10 it avoids damage to car doors by adjacent parkers.
