            Liz stares at the little orange pill. “Adderall is for attention deficit disorder. You don’t have that, do you?”
            “No” says Amy. “I got the tab from my boyfriend, Zach, who talked the health clinic out of a whole bottle by faking ADD.”
            “Wow,” says Liz. “Do you think it’s safe for me to take it?”
            “Of course” replies Amy. “Zach takes it all the time when he needs an extra spurt of energy, and he’s had no adverse reactions. I’ve even tried it once or twice. If it’s safe for Zach, then it’s safe for me, and if it’s safe for me, then it’s safe for you. The conclusion is obvious.”

            “Okay,” says Amy. “But maybe your problem isn’t as bad as you think. Consider this: Older people take drugs all the time to help their memory and their sex lives. If it’s okay for them to take those drugs—and it is—then it’s okay for you to take the Adderall. You shouldn’t sweat it.”

            “The problem with that line of reasoning,” Liz observes, “is that using light bulbs and cell phones doesn’t put anyone at a competitive advantage. Everyone uses them, so we’re all on an equal footing. But not every student uses Adderall to pass a test. If everyone used it, I would have no problem with it. But not everyone uses it, so I do have a problem.”

          <p>6.7.V#6</p>
          <p>
            If the death penalty deters one person from becoming a murderer, it is effective. There are also some other important reasons for having the death penalty. First, the families and friends of innocent victims have the right to see effective retribution. Second, terminating the life of a killer is more economical than keeping him in jail at the taxpayer’s expense. Third, everyone will have greater respect for the judicial system when justice is carried out.

          <p>
            A country that replaces the diseased hearts of old white men but refuses to feed schoolchildren, pay women adequately, educate adolescents, or care for the elderly—that country is doomed. We are acting as if there is no tomorrow. Where is our shame?
