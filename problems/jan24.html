            1 The United States is currently experiencing the greatest economic inequality since the 1920s, and 2 this inequality is depressing the economy. 3 The true sustainers of the economy are the bottom 99 percent of households, but 4 the top 1 percent takes in 93 percent of the growth in income. Also, 5 economic inequality is undercutting tax receipts, which are vital for infrastructure, education, and research. This is because 6 income earned by the rich is taxed at a far lower rate than income earned by the middle class.

            1 Programs to develop clean energy have seen some early notable successes. 2 The price of solar and wind power have both fallen sharply in recent years. 3 The nationâ€™s largest wind farm, sprawling across eastern Oregon, is now open and running, and 4 there is even good news from the natural gas front. 5 The use of natural gas, which is far cleaner than coal, to generate electricity has jumped substantially in the last few years, and 6 thanks to government-sponsored research, energy companies are now able to extract much more gas from a tract of land than once seemed possible.

            1 Doctors who attend elderly people in nursing homes often prescribe tranquilizers to keep these people immobile. 2 This practice is often unwarranted, and 3 it often impairs the health of the patients. 4 These tranquilizers often have damaging side effects in that 5 they accentuate the symptoms of senility, and 6 they increase the likelihood of a dangerous fall because 7 they produce unsteadiness in walking. Furthermore, since 8 these medications produce immobility, 9 they increase the risk of bedsores. 10 Doctors at the Center for Aging and Health say that physicians who care for the elderly are simply prescribing too much medication.

            1 All of us have encountered motorists who will go to any length to get a parking spot within 20 feet of the door they expect to enter. 2 This obsession with good parking spots transcends all logic. 3 It might take 5 minutes to secure the ideal spot in a store parking lot, 4 while a more distant spot that is immediately available is only a 40-second walk from the door. 5 Waiting for that ideal spot also results in frenzied nerves and skyrocketing blood pressure. 6 Inevitably the occupant of the desired space will preen her hair before departing, and 7 all the while the cars backed up behind the waiting driver are blaring their horns. 8 Parking a little farther away is usually easier and safer because 9 you can pull out more quickly, and 10 it avoids damage to car doors by adjacent parkers.
